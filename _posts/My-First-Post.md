title: My Magento Developer Journey 
---

Hello and welcome to my first blog post! My name is Betül Algür
and I'm excited to share my journey as a junior Magento developer at Aize Software and Education.


Today, I'd like to talk about my experience building my first blog using GitHub Pages.

As a developer, I knew that having a blog would be an excellent way to share my insights and experiences with the community, as well as to document my progress and growth as a developer. 
I chose GitHub Pages because of its ease of use and integration with Git, which allows me to manage my blog content and code in one place.

To get started, I first had to choose a Jekyll theme that suited my style and preferences. After some research, I settled on a clean and minimalist theme that allowed me to focus on my content rather than distracting design elements.

Overall, building my first blog has been a rewarding and educational experience. look forward to continuing to document my Magento developer journey and sharing my insights with you all. Thank you for reading!
